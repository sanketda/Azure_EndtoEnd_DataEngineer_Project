# Azure_EndtoEnd_DataEngineer_Project

**Problem Statement-**

In this project, we take on premise SQL server data to Azure Blog Storage with Azure Data Factory(by using Pipeline) and then taken this data on databricks for preprocessing and used pyspark and taken useful data and ignored unnecessary.
